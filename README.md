# Data-Driven_Balboa32U4

This repository contains all the code and data required to reproduce the results found in the master thesis: "From Model-Based to Data-Driven Control: Application to Self-Balancing Robots."

## Model-Based Control Folder

This folder includes a Jupyter notebook, `ModelBasedSimulation.ipynb`, which represents all numerical and experimental results for the model-based approach. The results are based on specific data and are saved in the plot folder.

## Data-Driven Control Folder

This folder includes a Jupyter notebook, `DataDrivenSimulation.ipynb`, which represents the results for the data-driven approach. Each plot uses data from the respective MATLAB file. The different MATLAB files compile the data-driven methods for simulated and experimental data under various configurations. The results are saved in the plot folder.
